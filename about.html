<h1>hello this is page two,</h1>
<p>I'll be talking about more of fighting styles
  also about they're pros and cons they have and which boxers used them and how
 they countered the flaws to use to their advantage,for example like an 
outfighter like muhammad ali who liked to control the pace using his jab
and long range punchs despite being an heavy weight. </p>
<p>But the philly shell was a type of guard where you leave one side
  of ur face open and use ur lead hand usually being the left hand to
  parry jabs and block hooks while the bottom hand covers ur lower body
  and protects u from jabs by rolling ur shoulder, floyd mayweather uses
  the philly shell but he didn't always start out with it he usually starts
  with his guard up but after a few rounds he adapts to the philly shell
  parrying and dodging.
