    <h1>Hello, I'll be talking about boxing</h1>
    <p>I'm talking about the high guard</p>
    <img src="/boxing_gguy.avif">
    <p>The high guard is where you hold ur hands close to ur temples and head tucking ur elbows
    </p>
    <a href="https://legends.com.sg/boxing-high-guard/">Visit legends.com.sg/boxing-high-guard!</a>
<p> The pros of using a high guard are that head pucnhes don't do much and straight punches and minimizing
    the damage.</p>
<p> The cons of the high guard is limting ur movement and head movemnt and show ur opponent that ur desperate to recover 
    and make ur opponent fight a lot harder in hopes of knockin u out</p>
