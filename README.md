## Why did i make this website?
I made this website because I really enjoy the sport and the people that have done boxing like sugar ray lewis and the other boxers that have done it before them changing the sport 
every new decade whether it be a champion or an old man like gorege foreman or one of the fastesg heavy weights like Ali...
## What did I learn during this project?
During this project i learned:
 - Css is more complex than i thought.
 - There are other websites to use other than github if not working.
 - Also some are also easier than others.
## Something I wish I knew before starting this project
I wish that i knew that html and css is very easy to break if not careful.
## My next project 
For my next project I would love to get more in depth in boxing or a website/travia game.
### By coding from home and watching videos about the certain thing im doing in code.
### About the person who made this
